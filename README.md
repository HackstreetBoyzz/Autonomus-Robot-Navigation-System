Autonomous Robot Navigation System ü§ñ
üìå Project Overview

This project implements an Autonomous Mobile Robot (TurtleBot) that can navigate its environment intelligently. The robot integrates Arduino C programming, sensors, motor control, and a web-based Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) controller for manual operation.

It supports three operating modes:

Obstacle Avoidance (using ultrasonic sensor)

Path Following (using IR sensors)

Manual Control (via BLE web app)

The project demonstrates embedded C concepts like loops, conditionals, arrays, functions, structures, interrupts, and modular design.
